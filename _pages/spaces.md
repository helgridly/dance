Here's a list of the dance spaces I've found in NYC. If you have more that you know of and are willing to share, please contact me on WhatsApp if you already have my number or @husseindances on Instagram if you don't.

### Gibney

* Location: two locations in Manhattan, [280 Broadway](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y3iGg2ReqmQYf5Bm7) (downtown, right opposite City Hall / Chambers St) and [890 Broadway](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WEXvsNxc2o3yj5Aq6) (W 19th, north of Union Sq)
* Space & cost: Many studios available. Listings and photos [here](https://gibneydance.org/center/#center__space). Prices are not public, you have to contact them; some info in the table below.

| Studio | Size | Price /hr |
|--------|------|-------|
| [Studio X](https://gibneydance.org/spaces/studio-x/) @ 280 Broadway | 960sqft | $110 |
| [Studio W](https://gibneydance.org/spaces/studio-w/) @ 280 Broadway | 1200sqft | $115 |
| [Studio U](https://gibneydance.org/spaces/studio-u/) @ 280 Broadway | 1650sqft | $135 |

* Availability: I think pretty good. I asked with two weeks' notice and they gave me three options.
* Hours: 10am - 10pm. Security will escort you out of the building at 10.20pm.
* Floor: Sprung marley.
* Tables, etc: Tables, chairs, coatracks free.
* Sound: Ceiling mounted speakers and a full A/V setup that accepts XLR, TRS, 3.5mm aux, etc. Unfortunately the speakers are terrible - all top end, no bass, aimed at the floor. They charged me $100 to rent sound deadening curtains; I negotiated them down to $70.
* Cancellation policy: 8 weeks notice, but they'll let you put a hold on a studio for around a week before you have to pay or give up the slot.

On the day of my class, staff were late arriving to set up the sound deadening curtains and lethargic in doing so. My class started 15 minutes late as a result.

### New York Live Arts

* Location: [Chelsea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RuXjLjtNqKDCYQuBA)
* Space & cost: Two spaces, called "White" and "Robbins", both 1200sqft, that can be rented separately or with the partition wall between them taken down to make one large space. Details [here](https://newyorklivearts.org/about/rent-space/studio/)

| Studio | Size | Price /hr |
|--------|------|-------|
| White | 1200sqft | $75 |
| Robbins | 1200sqft | $75 |

* Availability: Extremely booked out, especially weekday evenings. Calendar [here](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ASP/main_appts.asp?studioid=18911)
* Hours: 8am-10pm.
* Price: $75/hr for either room.
* Floor: Sprung marley.
* Tables, etc: Don't know.
* Sound: Two speakers on stands in each room. Don't know about connectors.
* Cancellation policy: 2 weeks, though if you cancel later than that and someone takes your reservation, they'll refund you.

[Tim Doody](https://5rxtd.com/) used to rent this space for his classes, he might be able to answer questions.

### Joffrey Ballet School

* Location: Manhattan, [W 10th x 6th Ave](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MX7KaRGS8xp1pLi19). (There's also one in LIC.)
* Space & cost:  
    Many spaces, of varying quality. Some are awkward L shapes, some are big rooms with columns. Range from 1000 to 1800sqft.  
    Prices range from $70-120/hr for Manhattan, $30-40 for LIC. Listing [here](https://www.joffreyballetschool.com/rentals/). Scroll down and once you choose a location it'll update with prices.
* Availability: Extremely booked out, especially weekday evenings. Calendar [here](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ASP/main_appts.asp?studioid=18911)
* Hours: 8am-9pm. NYCity Waves on Tuesday nights has an extension to 10pm because they've been renting for literal decades; when I asked for the same, I was told it was above her pay grade and she'd have to go up the chain for permission.
* Floor: Very sprung marley. Boing!
* Tables, etc: Don't know.
* Sound: There are small speakers on stands in each room but I don't know anything about them. NYCity Waves (Tues night) and Sunday ReSet share speakers in storage on premises but you'd have to ask if you can borrow them; they seemed a bit reluctant when I asked.
* Cancellation policy: 1 week's notice.


### Paul Taylor

### Triskelion Arts

* Location: [Greenpoint](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ek2FBFCcimBPALc78)
* Space & cost: [Listing here](https://www.triskelionarts.org/our-studios). Note that they will let you double the capacity limit listed under "rehearsal max occupancy" but that will double the cost of the rental.
* Availability: Fairly booked but slots available. Calendar [here](https://www.triskelionarts.org/availability-calendar)
* Hours: 9am-10pm. You get a key (one-off fee for this).
* Floor: Marley in theater, wood (unsure if sprung, probably) otherwise.

* Cancellation policy: Don't know.

### My Room

* Location: 
* Space & cost: Listings [here](https://www.myroomisyourroom.com/spaces.html). He charges $50/hr for Birch (dance floor) & Desert (waiting area with couches) combined. Listing says capacity is 20 but there's a Biodanza there that regularly gets 30+ and they're happy.
* Availability: Weekday evenings are booked out for months; weekends more possible.
* Hours: Not listed.
* Floor: Cork. A bit of spring.
* Tables, etc: Yes.
* Sound: Ceiling mounted speakers with an aux cord. Not good.
* Cancellation policy: Don't know.

This place is clearly one guy's passion project and he's really interested in building community; he hinted that you can get even cheaper rates if you develop a sustained relationship with them. He also has storage space in the building that he can bundle in for a little extra $.

### Movement Gowanus

* Location: [Gowanus, Brooklyn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CHyfXquyVoGUy7376)
* Space & cost: 1125sqft yoga / fitness studio. Call or ask at the front desk for rates; it's handled by one guy who seems to be making it up. You can probably negotiate.
* Availability: Some. If you flip through the [calendar](https://movementgyms.com/gowanus/calendar/?location=gowanus) and select "Yoga" and "Fitness" on the left, you can see what's already there.
* Hours: 7am-11pm weekdays, 9am-10pm weekends.
* Floor: Wood over concrete.
* Tables, etc: Don't know.
* Sound: Crappy ceiling speakers.
* Cancellation policy: Don't know.
