I've found myself wanting to spend more time at my edge in my dances. Exploring darker, harder, more intense; asking more from my practice. Undertow is my attempt at making the thing I've been seeking.

Why Undertow? That's the feeling I get from dances I like: of being pulled down, under, into surrender.

**For the time being I do not recommend Undertow to dancers without an established movement meditation practice.** Undertow dances can be intense and difficult: if you don't feel confident in your ability to pace yourself and self-regulate, this is not the dance for you.

The one promise I make is that we will always, _always_ land gently.
