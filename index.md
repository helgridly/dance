It's called Undertow because that's the feeling I get from dances I like: of being pulled down, under, into surrender.

I've been wanting to spend more time at my edge in my dances lately. Exploring darker, harder, more intense; asking more from my practice. Undertow is my attempt at making the thing I've been seeking.

There's two sets: a "warmup set", which is my take on what you're used to; and then the main event. We run a little longer than usual to give it room to breathe, and to make sure we come down ever so gently.
